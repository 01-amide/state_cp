      Root div element - this is the mounting point for the React application
      The React app will render inside this div, replacing its contents
      
      Important characteristics:
      - Must have a unique ID that matches what's referenced in main.jsx
      - Should be empty initially (React will populate it)
      - Can contain fallback content for users with JavaScript disabled
    -->
    <div id="root">
      <!-- 
        Fallback content for users with JavaScript disabled
        This content will be visible until React loads and renders
        
        Example fallback content:
        <noscript>
          <h1>JavaScript Required</h1>
          <p>This application requires JavaScript to function properly.</p>
          <p>Please enable JavaScript in your browser and refresh the page.</p>

      Script tag that loads the main JavaScript entry point
      
      Attributes explained:
      - type="module": Enables ES6 module syntax and modern JavaScript features
      - src="/src/main.jsx": Path to the main React application file
      
      The /src/ path is relative to the project root and will be processed
      by Vite during development and build
    -->
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
    
    <!-- 
      Additional considerations for production applications:
      
      1. Performance optimization:
         - Add preload links for critical resources
         - Implement service worker for offline functionality
         - Add resource hints (dns-prefetch, preconnect)
      
      2. Analytics and monitoring:
         - Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager
         - Error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)
         - Performance monitoring (Web Vitals)
      
      3. Security:
         - Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
         - Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external resources
         - Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

  HTML Structure Summary:
  
  This file serves as the entry point for the React State Checkpoint application.
  It provides the basic HTML structure and the mounting point for the React app.
  
  Key elements:
  - Proper HTML5 doctype and language declaration
  - Essential meta tags for responsive design and character encoding
  - Root div with id="root" for React mounting
  - Script tag loading the main React application
  
  The React application will:
  1. Load and initialize when this HTML file is opened
  2. Mount into the #root div element
  3. Take over the page rendering and user interaction
  4. Handle all dynamic content and state management
